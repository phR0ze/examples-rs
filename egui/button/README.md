# egui button examples

## Notes
* Doesn't seem to be a way to turn off button hovering visual affects
* No way to control just button size manually without also controlling positioning manually
* Button implementation is simply done via painter which is exposed
* Button is drawn at origin then redrawn at desired location with visible delay between
* When drawing a simple rectangle there seems to be a visible delay as it is positioned

## Backlog
* Button 3/4 screen width
